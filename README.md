# Duperemove

Duperemove is a simple tool for finding duplicated extents and
submitting them for deduplication. When given a list of files it will
hash their contents on a block by block basis and compare those hashes
to each other, finding and categorizing extents that match each
other. When given the -d option, duperemove will submit those
extents for deduplication using the Linux kernel extent-same ioctl.

Duperemove can store the hashes it computes in a 'hashfile'. If
given an existing hashfile, duperemove will only compute hashes
for those files which have changed since the last run.  Thus you can run
duperemove repeatedly on your data as it changes, without having to
re-checksum unchanged data.

Duperemove can also take input from the [fdupes](https://github.com/adrianlopezroche/fdupes) program.

See [the duperemove man page](http://markfasheh.github.io/duperemove/duperemove.html) for further details about running duperemove.

# Examples

Please see the examples section of [the duperemove man
page](http://markfasheh.github.io/duperemove/duperemove.html#7)
for a complete set of usage examples, including hashfile usage.

## A simple example, with program output

Duperemove takes a list of files and directories to scan for
dedupe. If a directory is specified, all regular files within it will
be scanned. Duperemove can also be told to recursively scan
directories with the '-r' switch. If '-h' is provided, duperemove will
print numbers in powers of 1024 (e.g., "128K").

Assume this abitrary layout for the following examples.

    .
    ├── dir1
    │   ├── file3
    │   ├── file4
    │   └── subdir1
    │       └── file5
    ├── file1
    └── file2

This will dedupe files 'file1' and 'file2':

    duperemove -dh file1 file2

This does the same but adds any files in dir1 (file3 and file4):

    duperemove -dh file1 file2 dir1

This will dedupe exactly the same as above but will recursively walk
dir1, thus adding file5.

    duperemove -dhr file1 file2 dir1/


An actual run, output will differ according to duperemove version.
